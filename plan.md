# Solar Manager — Implementation Plan

A **vendor-agnostic** management & statistics webapp for solar/battery systems — inverters, battery banks, and PV arrays — built so that any brand can be added via a driver/profile.
Goal: **instant**, **historical**, and **projected** (forecast) views of the system.

First hardware target is a **Sunsynk** inverter over RS485, but Sunsynk is just the first *profile*, not a baked-in assumption. Other brands (Deye, Growatt, Victron, SunSpec-compliant kit, etc.) are added by writing a profile, not by touching the core.

---

## 1. Scope & Core Requirements

| Capability | Description |
|---|---|
| **Instant** | Live readings — PV power, load, battery SoC/voltage/current/temp, grid import/export, inverter state. Polled every few seconds. |
| **Historical** | Persisted time-series. Browse/aggregate by hour/day/month. Energy totals (kWh), self-consumption, autonomy, costs. |
| **Projected** | Forecast PV generation & expected battery trajectory using [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com) irradiance + system config. |
| **Pluggable transport** | Start on **RS485 (Modbus RTU)**; swap to **Solarman / SolarmanV5 Wi-Fi**, Modbus TCP, etc. later with no changes above the driver layer. |
| **Pluggable vendors** | Each brand is a **device profile** (register map + decode); adding one never touches core logic. **Sunsynk / Sol-Ark / Deye share the same Deye-built firmware & protocol**, so one profile family covers all three. Others (Growatt, Victron, generic SunSpec) added as needed. Mixed-brand systems supported (e.g. inverter from vendor A + battery BMS from vendor B). |
| **Control / write-back** | Read **and write** device settings — the inverter **work-mode timer** (per-slot time, target SoC, power, grid-charge / gen-charge toggles) + global work mode, and **BMS settings where writable** (through the inverter if it relays writes, else via a direct BMS connection — see Decision #3). Edit in the UI and push to the device. Writes are guarded (validate → confirm → write → read-back verify); see §4 & §12. |

**Deployment context (by design, not just v1):** a **single house, installed on the home LAN**. No multi-site, and **no user authentication** — it is not internet-exposed and serves one household, so there are no accounts, logins, or roles to build. This keeps the app simple; security relies on it living behind the home network (don't port-forward it). *(Control is **in scope** — see §4 & §12 — but writes are gated behind a deploy flag, validation, confirmation, and read-back verification, not behind user auth.)*

```

The driver layer has **two orthogonal seams**:
1. **Transport** — *how* register reads happen (serial cable vs. TCP socket vs. Solarman frame).
2. **Device profile** — *what* the registers mean for a given brand/model (map, scaling, sign conventions).

Everything above the driver works only in **normalized units** and never knows the brand or the wire. A running system is a set of **devices**, each pairing one transport with one profile — so a Sunsynk inverter on RS485 and a separate battery BMS on Modbus TCP coexist, and their readings merge into one system view.

---

## 3. Technology Choices

> Recommendations, not hard requirements. Rationale given so they can be swapped.

- **Backend language: Python 3.11+** — richest Modbus/solar ecosystem (`pymodbus`, `umodbus`, `pysolarmanv5`, plus community register maps for Sunsynk/Deye/Growatt and the SunSpec models that cover many brands). Async via `asyncio`.
- **Web framework: FastAPI** — async, typed, auto OpenAPI docs, native WebSocket support for live push.
- **Time-series storage: SQLite + a rollup schema** for v1 (zero-ops, single file, perfect for one household). Abstract behind a repository so it can move to **TimescaleDB/InfluxDB** if retention/volume grows.
- **Frontend: Angular + Bootstrap 5.3 admin UI** (see §8) — fixed header/footer/sidebar shell, light & dark themes via Bootstrap's standard color system, icons via **Bootstrap Icons**, charts via **Chart.js**, live updates over WebSocket. **All frontend assets (CSS, JS, fonts, icon webfont) are bundled and self-hosted — no CDN** (the app is built for offline, in-home LAN deployment with no guaranteed internet).
- **Deployment: native install on a Raspberry Pi (primary) — fresh Ubuntu**, Docker optional. Designed to run on a Pi / small Linux box physically wired to the RS485 adapter. See §13 for both paths.

---

## 4. The Device Abstraction (most important design decision)

Two **orthogonal** seams keep the app vendor- and wire-agnostic:

- **Transport** = *how* to read/write registers (Modbus RTU over serial, SolarmanV5 over TCP, Modbus TCP…). Knows nothing about brands.
- **Profile** = *what* the registers mean for a brand/model (address map, scaling, word order, sign conventions, daily-counter registers). Knows nothing about the wire.

A **`Device`** composes one transport + one profile. A running system has a **registry of N devices** whose readings are merged into one normalized snapshot.

### Interfaces

```python
@dataclass
class Reading:
    ts: datetime
    device_id: str
    metrics: dict[str, float]   # normalized keys + SI-ish units (W, Wh, V, A, %, °C)

# How bytes move — no brand knowledge.
class Transport(Protocol):
    async def connect(self) -> None: ...
    async def read_registers(self, start: int, count: int) -> list[int]: ...
    async def write_registers(self, start: int, values: list[int]) -> None: ...  # control
    async def close(self) -> None: ...

# What the registers mean — no wire knowledge.
class DeviceProfile(Protocol):
    vendor: str                                  # "sunsynk", "deye", "sunspec"…
    def register_blocks(self) -> list[RegBlock]: ...        # what to read
    def decode(self, raw: dict[int, int]) -> dict[str, float]: ...  # -> normalized keys
    # --- control (optional; absent => read-only device) ---
    def settings_schema(self) -> SettingsSchema | None: ...  # what's writable (e.g. work-mode timer)
    def read_settings(self, raw: dict[int, int]) -> Settings: ...     # registers -> typed settings
    def encode_settings(self, s: Settings) -> dict[int, int]: ...     # typed settings -> registers
    @property
    def info(self) -> DeviceInfo: ...            # serial, model, firmware

# Composition the rest of the app consumes.
class Device:
    def __init__(self, transport: Transport, profile: DeviceProfile): ...
    async def read(self) -> Reading: ...             # transport.read_registers → profile.decode
    async def get_settings(self) -> Settings: ...    # read current control settings
    async def apply_settings(self, s: Settings) -> Settings: ...
        # validate → encode → write_registers → re-read → verify → return confirmed state
```

**Reads and writes are separate capabilities.** Control is **optional** on a profile: if `settings_schema()` returns `None` the device is read-only and the app hides all control UI for it (presence of a schema *is* the "supports control" signal, surfaced to the UI via `/api/devices`). The dummy and any monitor-only devices simply don't implement the write path.

Profiles are mostly **data, not code**: a versioned `profiles/<vendor>.yaml` declaring each metric's register address, scale, signedness, word order, and unit. Adding a brand = adding a YAML (+ rare custom decode for odd ones). A **`SunSpec` profile** can cover many standards-compliant brands at once.

**Shared base profiles via inheritance.** Sunsynk, Sol-Ark, and Deye are the *same* Deye-built hardware/firmware, so they share one base register map. Model the YAML with a **`deye-base` profile** that the three brands extend, overriding only what differs (model-size power ratings, the odd address, branding). One map maintained once → three brands supported; the same pattern serves any future rebadge family.

### Normalized metric vocabulary (canonical keys)
Profiles translate raw registers → these keys. The rest of the app only ever sees these (brand-independent):

```
pv_power_w (sum of MPPTs), pv1_power_w, pv1_voltage_v, pv1_current_a,
pv2_power_w, pv2_voltage_v, pv2_current_a,
battery_soc_pct, battery_power_w (+charge/-discharge), battery_voltage_v,
battery_current_a, battery_temp_c,
grid_power_w (+import/-export), grid_voltage_v, grid_frequency_hz,
load_power_w, inverter_temp_c,
today_pv_wh, today_load_wh, today_grid_import_wh, today_grid_export_wh,
today_batt_charge_wh, today_batt_discharge_wh,
inverter_status, run_state, inverter_fault_codes, inverter_warning_codes,
battery_soh_pct, battery_cycles, battery_capacity_ah_measured
```

Keys split into **mandatory core** (power/SoC/voltages — most profiles report these) and **optional** (faults, SoH, cell detail — capability-gated, §17). Status/fault keys carry *decoded* values (a list of human-readable codes), not raw bitfields. The vocabulary is **phase-agnostic**: single- vs. three-phase is handled by per-phase suffixes (`grid_power_l1_w`…) that collapse to the unsuffixed total for single-phase rigs, so the SG05LP1 and a future 3-phase inverter share the same UI.

### Control settings model (schema-driven, inverter-agnostic)
Writable settings are described by a **declarative `SettingsSchema`** the profile returns — the UI is **generated from this schema**, never hard-coded per brand. The same Settings/Control page renders whatever any inverter advertises:

```python
class Field:        # one writable setting
    key: str; label: str
    type: Literal["int","float","bool","enum","time"]
    unit: str | None; min: float | None; max: float | None; step: float | None
    options: list[str] | None          # for enum
    group: str                          # UI grouping, e.g. "Timer slot 3"

class SettingsSchema:
    fields: list[Field]
    repeating: list[RepeatingGroup]     # e.g. the 6 work-mode timer slots
```

**Sunsynk work-mode timer** is the first concrete instance — modeled as a repeating group of **time slots** (the SG05LP1 has 6), each slot a normalized record:
```
slot: { start_time, target_soc_pct, power_w,
        charge_from_grid: bool, charge_from_gen: bool }
plus globals: { timer_enabled: bool, work_mode: enum[...] }
```
The profile maps these typed fields ↔ the actual holding registers (`encode_settings`/`read_settings`); the front end only ever sees the schema + typed values, so it works identically for a Deye, Growatt, etc. once their profile declares its own schema. Constraints (SoC 0–100, power ≤ inverter rating, valid times) live in the schema and are enforced both client- and server-side.

### Each profile self-describes (declares everything it can report)
A profile isn't just a decode table — it **advertises its capabilities** so the rest of the app (and the UI) adapt to whatever device is connected:
```python
class DeviceProfile(Protocol):
    vendor: str
    def capabilities(self) -> set[str]   # which normalized metric keys this device provides
    def info(self) -> DeviceInfo         # vendor, model, firmware, serial, ratings (kW, kWh)
```
The UI hides panels for metrics a device doesn't report (e.g. a DC-coupled battery BMS that has no grid data). Missing ≠ zero: unreported metrics are absent, not faked.

### Keeping the seam protocol-agnostic (beyond Modbus)
The `Transport`/`DeviceProfile` interfaces above are the **Modbus-family form** — they speak in *registers* (`read_registers`, `decode(raw: dict[int,int])`). Most target vendors are Modbus, but **not all are**, so the *cross-family* contract is deliberately narrower: a `Device` only owes the rest of the app a **`Reading` (canonical metrics)** and an optional **`SettingsSchema`** (§7 vocabulary). *How* a device produces those is a **protocol family**, and Transport+Profile are paired **within** a family:
- **Modbus family** (RTU / TCP / SolarmanV5): the register interface shown above; profiles are YAML register maps. Covers the large majority of vendors and **SunSpec** (one profile, many compliant brands).
- **Text command/response family**: proprietary ASCII protocols (Voltronic/Axpert & many Must models speak `PI30`/`QPIGS…` command→response with a CRC, over serial or USB-HID). No register space — the profile is a *command set + field layout*, the transport sends commands and returns frames. The register Protocol does **not** fit; this family has its own transport+profile contract.
- **Victron family**: its own ecosystem — integrate via Venus OS (GX) Modbus-TCP or MQTT, or VE.Direct text on smaller units. Again its own transport(s)+profile.

All three still emit the **same normalized `Reading`**, so everything above the driver (storage, stats, forecast, UI, egress, alerts) is untouched. The lesson for v1: **don't let the register model leak above the driver** — keep `dict[int,int]` and Modbus specifics inside the Modbus family, so adding the text/Victron families later is additive, not a refactor. See §20 for the vendor roadmap this enables.

### v1 transport — `ModbusRtuSource`
- `pymodbus` async serial client over `/dev/ttyUSB0` (USB↔RS485 adapter).
- Config: serial port, baud (9600/default), Modbus slave id. Brand-agnostic.

### First profile — `SunsynkProfile` (target: `SYNK-8K-SG05LP1`)
- Built on the shared **`deye-base`** map (since Sunsynk = Sol-Ark = Deye firmware); `profiles/sunsynk-8k-sg05lp1.yaml` extends it with this model's ratings/overrides (address, scale, signedness, word order, unit).
- **Sol-Ark and Deye come almost for free** — once `deye-base` is validated here, they're thin profiles pointing at the same map.
- Battery metrics come **via the inverter** (it manages the LiFePO₄ BMS), so `capabilities()` includes the battery keys — no separate BMS device on this rig.
- Handle Sunsynk quirks: signed values, 16/32-bit registers, scaling factors, sign conventions for battery/grid direction.
- Reports the full canonical metric set above; validated against the inverter's own display.
- **Control:** implements `settings_schema`/`read_settings`/`encode_settings` for the **work-mode timer** (6 slots + globals) — the writable holding registers, also discovered/validated via §11. Only active when the control deploy-flag is on (§12).

#### Validation status (first real scan — drafted into `profiles/`)
**Draft profiles `profiles/deye-base.yaml` + `profiles/sunsynk-8k-sg05lp1.yaml` exist now**, built from a `regscan --map` capture of the actual unit and cross-checked against physics. Confirmed against the live device:
- **It is a 1PH unit** (the 3PH register bank 500–708 reads all-zero) → the kellerza **`1PH` column** is correct.
- **Internal consistency**: `battery_power 749 W = 52.85 V × 14.18 A`; `inverter_current 2.7 A ≈ 656 W / 248.6 V`; `rated_power [16,17] = 8000 W`; frequencies/voltages all sane.
- **32-bit word order is LOW-WORD-FIRST** (proven by rated power + energy counters; note `total_grid_import [78,80]` is non-adjacent — 79 is grid frequency).
- **Temperatures use Sunsynk `(°C+100)×10`** — decode `raw/10 − 100` (battery 22.0, radiator 33.3, DC-xfmr 39.4 °C). The kellerza TSV's plain `×0.1` is wrong here; regscan's cell syntax now supports a trailing offset (`[182] * 0.1 - 100`) and the bundled `sunsynk-deye.tsv` carries it.
- **Work-mode timer control map confirmed**: 6 slots at Time `[250-255]`, Power `[256-261]`, Capacity/target-SoC `[268-273]`, charge/mode bits `[274-279]`, plus `Use Timer [248]&0x01` and `Grid charge [232]&0x01`. Serial is ASCII at `[3-7]`.
- **✓ Sign conventions resolved (grid-charging capture)**: while grid-charging the battery, `battery_power [190] = −3968 W` and `battery_current [191] = s16 −73.43 A` (−73.43 × 54.04 V = −3968 W ✓) → this unit is **discharge-positive**, so `battery_power_w`/`battery_current_a` are **negated** to the canonical **+charge/−discharge** (the latter was also wrongly typed `u16` — it is `s16`). `grid_power [169] = +4794 W` while importing → **import-positive**, which already matches canonical **+import/−export** (no flip). A daytime capture also confirmed `pv1_voltage_v` (265.1 V under load) and the `solar_export [247]` setting (toggle-verified 0→1). *Remaining:* grid **export** polarity (assumed s16-negative) still needs a **battery-full + PV-surplus** scan — the daytime capture didn't export (battery at 61 %).

### Dummy / simulator profile — `DummyProfile` (build FIRST)
- A built-in **fake inverter** that needs no hardware and no wiring — pairs with a `NullTransport` (or any transport, ignored).
- Generates **realistic, time-of-day-aware** synthetic readings: a solar bell-curve for PV, a plausible load profile, a battery that charges by day / discharges at night, occasional grid import/export — so charts, stats, and forecast all have believable data.
- Reports the **complete** canonical metric set, so every UI panel and code path is exercisable.
- Deterministic seed option for tests; also drives unit/integration tests and CI without serial hardware.
- **Accepts writes in-memory** — implements the control path (mirrors a work-mode-timer schema), so the entire validate→write→read-back flow and Control UI can be developed and tested with zero risk before going near a real inverter.
- This is the default device on a fresh install until real hardware is configured.

### Later transport — `SolarmanV5Source`
- `pysolarmanv5` (TCP to the logger on port 8899, needs logger serial number).
- **Reuses the exact same profiles** — SolarmanV5 wraps the identical Modbus payload, so only the framing/transport differs; the Sunsynk (or any) profile decodes unchanged.
- Selected purely via config (`transport: modbus_rtu | solarman_v5 | modbus_tcp`); no code changes upstream.

## 5. Data Model & Storage

**Raw samples** (high-frequency, short retention e.g. 7–30 days) — tagged by device:
```
samples(ts, device_id, metric, value)   -- narrow table; device_id supports mixed-brand systems
```

**Rollups** (downsampled, long retention) — also tagged by device, same as raw:
```
rollup_5m(bucket_ts, device_id, metric, avg, min, max, last)
rollup_1h(bucket_ts, device_id, metric, ...)
rollup_1d(date, device_id, metric, energy_wh, soc_min, soc_max, ...)
```

- Aggregator job rolls raw → 5m → 1h → 1d on a schedule; prune raw past retention. **Retention windows are user-configurable** in Settings.
- **Schema migrations via Alembic** (§19) so app upgrades never lose accumulated history; migrations run on startup, behind the repository abstraction.
- Energy (Wh) derived by integrating power over time **or** by diffing the inverter's own daily counters (prefer counters where available, they're authoritative; reset detection at midnight).

**Config DB** (small relational tables / JSON):
- **Devices**: `id`, `vendor/profile`, `transport` + its params (port/baud/slave-id or host/serial), poll interval, enabled flag. One row per physical device; a system can hold several. A **direct-connected BMS is just another device row** (its own transport + BMS profile).
- **BMS topology** (per battery): `inverter_relayed_read` | `inverter_relayed_readwrite` | `direct` — see Decision #3. Tells the app where battery metrics come from and **whether/where BMS settings are writable** (on the inverter's control page vs. a separate BMS device's). For `direct`, references the BMS device row above.
- System spec: **one or more array segments** (each: kWp, tilt, azimuth, string layout, **+ panel datasheet params: Temperature Coefficient of Pmax %/°C and NMOT °C**) for the inverter's 2 MPPTs; battery capacity (inverter reports **Ah**, e.g. 312 Ah → kWh via nominal voltage; auto-detected when the inverter exposes it, else user-set, **inverter wins** — see Decision #3) & chemistry; inverter model; location (lat/lon/timezone). All user-editable in Settings.
- Tariffs: **import (purchase)** and **export (feed-in)** each modeled as flat *or* time-of-use windows (with optional seasonal variants) for cost/savings stats.

---

## 6. Forecast Service (Projected)

- Source: **Open-Meteo Forecast API** — `shortwave_radiation` (GHI), plus cloud cover and **air temperature** (`temperature_2m`, drives the thermal derate below); free, no key, hourly.
- Convert irradiance → expected PV power **per array segment** (the SG05LP1 has 2 MPPTs; user may have e.g. east + west strings at different tilt/azimuth), then sum:
  `P_segment ≈ kWp × (POA_irradiance / 1000) × performance_ratio × temp_derate`
  - POA from GHI via each segment's tilt/azimuth transposition (start simple: GHI×factor; refine with a transposition model later).
  - **`temp_derate` from the panel datasheet** (these ABC modules) rather than a fixed fudge:
    - Cell temp via the NMOT model: `T_cell = T_air + (NMOT − 20)/800 × POA_irradiance` (W/m²).
    - Power derate: `temp_derate = 1 + (γ_Pmax / 100) × (T_cell − 25)`, where **γ_Pmax = Temperature Coefficient of Pmax** (%/°C, negative) and **NMOT** are entered per module type. So on hot, bright days the forecast correctly drops.
  - `performance_ratio` (wiring/inverter/soiling losses) still calibrated empirically against measured history — now a smaller correction since temperature is modeled explicitly.
- Outputs:
  - **Expected generation curve** for today/tomorrow (overlay on actuals).
  - **Battery trajectory projection**: forecast PV − forecast load (from historical load profile by hour/weekday) → projected SoC over next 24–48h; flag predicted depletion or full-charge times.
- Cache forecasts; refresh a few times/day. Store forecast-vs-actual to track model accuracy.

## 8. Frontend — Bootstrap Admin UI

### Shell & layout
A classic fixed admin layout built on **Bootstrap 5.3** (no heavyweight admin template dependency — just Bootstrap + a thin custom layout so it stays maintainable):

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Fixed header (brand · live status pill · theme   ▮ │  ← fixed-top navbar
├──────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Fixed    │                                         │
│ sidebar  │   Scrollable content area               │
│ (nav)    │   (the only part that scrolls)          │
│          │                                         │
├──────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Fixed footer (version · last-sample age · clock) ▮ │  ← fixed-bottom
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Fixed header** (`navbar fixed-top`): brand, live connection status pill (green/amber/red driven by `/api/health`), theme toggle, sidebar collapse button.
- **Fixed sidebar**: vertical nav to the views below; collapses to icons / off-canvas (`offcanvas`) on narrow screens for mobile.
- **Fixed footer** (`fixed-bottom`): app version, last-sample age ("updated 3s ago"), wall clock.
- **Content** is the only scrolling region (offset by header/footer/sidebar via CSS padding/margins).

### Theming — light & dark
- Use Bootstrap 5.3's **native color modes**: `data-bs-theme="light" | "dark"` on `<html>`. No custom CSS framework needed.
- Stick to **standard Bootstrap semantic colors** — `primary/success/warning/danger/info` and theme-aware surface variables (`--bs-body-bg`, `--bs-secondary-bg` for cards/sidebar). This keeps both themes consistent for free.
- Suggested semantic mapping for the domain: PV/solar = `warning` (yellow), battery = `success` (green), grid import = `danger`, grid export/feed-in = `info`, load = `primary`.
- Theme toggle persists to `localStorage`; default follows `prefers-color-scheme`.

### Charts & live update
- **Chart.js** (theme-aware: re-read CSS color variables on theme switch) for time-series lines, stacked energy bars, and gauges/doughnuts for SoC.
- **Live update path**: WebSocket `/ws/live` pushes each new `Reading`; a small client store updates gauges/flow diagram instantly and appends to the rolling live chart without a full refetch. History/forecast charts load via REST and refresh on demand.
- Graceful degradation: if the socket drops, status pill goes amber and the client falls back to polling `/api/live`.

### Views (sidebar nav)
1. **Now** — energy-flow diagram (PV → house / battery / grid) using Bootstrap cards + semantic colors, live SoC & power gauges, connection health, and a **fault/alarm banner** when the inverter reports faults (§16). Optional battery-detail panel (SoH, cell voltages) when the BMS exposes it (§17).
2. **History** — selectable metrics, date range, resolution; stacked energy bars (day/month); **day/period comparison overlay** (yesterday, same day last year); KPI cards (self-consumption, self-sufficiency, peak, **cost saved, CO₂ avoided, ROI/payback** §19). CSV/Excel export of the current view.
3. **Forecast** — tomorrow's expected generation curve, projected SoC line, "battery expected to reach X% by HH:MM", forecast-vs-actual accuracy.
4. **Control / Device Settings** — **device-agnostic, schema-driven** page, **per writable device**. Renders entirely from the selected device's `settings_schema()` (§4): a generic form builder maps `Field`/`RepeatingGroup` → Bootstrap inputs (number/toggle/enum/time), so the **same page edits any device's writable settings**. For the Sunsynk inverter it shows the **6 work-mode timer slots** (time, target SoC, power, charge-from-grid, charge-from-gen) plus global timer enable & work mode. **BMS settings appear here too, in the right place per topology** (Decision #3): on the *inverter's* page if it relays writes, or on a *separate BMS device's* page if directly connected. Flow: load current settings → edit → client+server validation → **confirm dialog** → write → read-back → show confirmed state (or diff/rollback on mismatch). Devices without a schema (dummy, monitor-only, read-only BMS) simply don't show this page.
5. **Settings** — **Devices** (add/edit/remove; pick vendor profile + transport + connection params; the dummy inverter is preconfigured), system spec, location, tariffs. UI panels driven by each device's advertised capabilities.

### Build approach
- **Angular 21 (standalone components) + TypeScript**, Bootstrap 5.3 added via styles (SCSS) rather than a heavyweight admin template.
- Bootstrap components via **`ng-bootstrap`** (native Angular widgets, no jQuery) — offcanvas sidebar, modals, toasts for alerts.
- Icons via **Bootstrap Icons** (`bootstrap-icons` npm package), used as the self-hosted SVG sprite / webfont — pairs natively with Bootstrap 5.3.
- Charts via **`ng2-charts`** (the Angular wrapper around Chart.js).
- **No CDN — self-host everything.** Bootstrap 5.3, Bootstrap Icons, Chart.js and any fonts are installed via npm and bundled by the Angular build into the static assets FastAPI serves. The deployed app must load with **zero outbound requests** (offline in-home LAN, §13); never reference `cdn.jsdelivr.net`, Google Fonts, or any external URL from the frontend. CI/install should fail if a CDN reference sneaks in.
- Live data via an Angular **service wrapping the WebSocket** as an RxJS `Observable` (e.g. `connect()` → stream of `Reading`s); components subscribe and update via the `async` pipe / signals. REST via `HttpClient` with TanStack-style caching optional.
- Theme handled by a `ThemeService` that sets `data-bs-theme` on `<html>` and persists to `localStorage`.
- Build the layout shell (header/sidebar/footer), `ThemeService`, and the WebSocket service as the first frontend pieces in Phase 0.

### Componentisation — everything reusable
The UI is built as **small, self-contained, reusable components**, not page-specific markup. The four pages are thin compositions of a shared component library.

- **Presentational vs. container split.** *Presentational* (dumb) components take data via `@Input()` and emit via `@Output()` — no services, no HTTP, no knowledge of where data comes from, so they're reusable and trivially testable. *Container* (smart) components wire services to presentational ones. A `<gauge>` doesn't care if its value is live, historical, or from the dummy.
- **Shared component library** (`shared/components/`) — reusable building blocks, each used in multiple places:
  - `<metric-card>` — labelled value + unit + trend (used across Now/History/Forecast).
  - `<gauge>` / `<soc-gauge>` — radial gauge for SoC, power, etc.
  - `<time-series-chart>` — wraps Chart.js; takes series + theme, used by History, Forecast, and the live chart.
  - `<energy-flow>` — the PV→house/battery/grid diagram, fed normalized metrics.
  - `<stat-tile>`, `<status-pill>`, `<date-range-picker>`, `<resolution-selector>`, `<confirm-dialog>`.
  - `<schema-form>` / `<schema-field>` — the generic form builder that renders any device's `settings_schema` (§4); already reusable by design, one field component per `Field.type`.
- **Configurable, not hard-coded.** Components are parameterised (units, colour role, thresholds, min/max) via inputs and use the theme's semantic colours — so the same `<gauge>` serves SoC, power, or temperature by configuration alone.
- **Standalone components + `OnPush` change detection**, typed input/output models shared with the API DTOs, and **signals** for reactive local state. Each component ships with its own unit test; consider **Storybook** to develop/showcase the library in isolation (and double as visual regression).
- **Smart/dumb keeps live-update isolated:** only container components subscribe to the WebSocket; presentational ones just re-render on input change — so reuse never drags data-fetching along.

## 9. Delivery Phases

- **Phase −1 — Register discovery (runs on the target machine):** a standalone **register-scanner CLI** (`tools/regscan.py`) — see §11 — that connects over RS485 to the SYNK-8K-SG05LP1 and **probes the full Modbus register space**, dumping each register's raw value (and common decodings). Run it repeatedly while changing known conditions to **reverse-engineer the map from observed values**, producing a first-cut `profiles/sunsynk-8k-sg05lp1.yaml`. Prerequisite to Phase 1; needs only Python + the USB-RS485 adapter, not the full app.
- **Phase 0 — Skeleton:** repo, FastAPI + Angular scaffolds, **native install path (systemd unit + `install.sh`) and an optional Dockerfile/Compose** (§13), `Transport`/`DeviceProfile`/`Device` interfaces, **`DummyProfile` simulator + `NullTransport`**, device registry, live WebSocket end-to-end driven by the dummy inverter. (No hardware needed — the whole app is usable from here. Can proceed in parallel with Phase −1.)
- **Phase 1 — Real instant data:** `ModbusRtuSource` transport + `SunsynkProfile` built from the Phase −1 map (`profiles/sunsynk-8k-sg05lp1.yaml`), validate readings against the Sunsynk's own display, live dashboard. Dummy remains for tests/CI.
- **Phase 2 — Persistence & history:** storage layer, poller writing samples, rollup jobs, history API + charts.
- **Phase 3 — Statistics:** daily/monthly energy, self-consumption/autonomy, tariff costs, **CO₂ & savings/ROI** (§19). Fault/alarm decoding (§16) and battery-health metrics (§17) land here too — they're just more decoded keys.
- **Phase 4 — Forecast:** Open-Meteo integration, PV model, SoC projection, forecast-vs-actual.
- **Phase 5 — Control / write-back (§12):** `write_registers`, profile `settings_schema`/`encode`/`read` for the Sunsynk work-mode timer, schema-driven Control page, validate→confirm→write→read-back. **Off by default** behind the deploy flag. Exercise the whole path against the **dummy inverter** (which accepts writes in-memory) before touching real hardware. Sequenced last so monitoring is rock-solid first.
- **Phase 6 — Alerts & integrations (§15, §14):** rule-based alerting + notification channels; MQTT publisher with **Home Assistant auto-discovery**; optional PVOutput / Prometheus / webhook egress. These are off the hot path and brand-independent (driven by the canonical vocabulary), so they come free for every profile.
- **Phase 7 — Polish & operational (§19):** energy-flow UI, first-run setup wizard, backup/restore & CSV export, diagnostics page, installable PWA, calibrate PR factor.
- **Later — Smart automation (§18):** tariff + forecast-driven auto-scheduling of the work-mode timer, opt-in and built on the Phase-5 control safeguards (Predbat-style). Listed last; the architecture is laid so it slots in without core changes.
- **Later — More vendors & transports:** `SolarmanV5Source`; **Sol-Ark & Deye profiles are near-free** (thin extends of the shared `deye-base` map validated in Phase 1); further families (Growatt, Victron, SunSpec) as demand arises — each a new YAML (+ its own settings schema for control), not a core change.

## 10. Key Risks & Decisions to Lock Early

- **Register map accuracy** — maps vary by vendor *and* by model/firmware within a vendor; verify every value against the device screen. Biggest source of bugs. Each profile needs its own validation pass.
- **Sign conventions** — battery charge/discharge & grid import/export polarity differ between brands; pin them **in each profile**, normalize before storage, never in the UI.
- **Capability variance** — devices report different subsets; the app and UI must handle absent metrics gracefully (driven by `capabilities()`), not assume every device provides everything.
- **Energy accounting** — counters vs. integration; handle midnight resets and missed samples.
- **RS485 reliability** — serial timeouts/retries, backoff, surfacing "stale data" honestly in the UI.
- **Polling cadence** — fast enough to feel live (~2–5s) without saturating the bus; decouple poll rate from persistence rate.
- **Write-back is the highest-risk feature** — a wrong holding-register write can mis-program the inverter (bad SoC targets, wrong charge windows). Mitigated by §12: off by default, schema-validated, confirmed, read-back-verified, write-register allow-list. Treat with more caution than everything else combined.

---

## 11. Register Discovery Tool (Phase −1)

A standalone CLI, **`tools/regscan.py`** (built — see `tools/README.md`), run **on the target machine** (the box wired to the inverter) to reverse-engineer the Sunsynk register map from observed values. Self-contained: Python + `pymodbus` + a USB-RS485 adapter; **no app, DB, or Angular needed**. A `--mock` mode runs the whole workflow with no hardware.

> **Head-start: a known community map exists.** The Deye/Sunsynk family is already mapped by the **[kellerza/sunsynk](https://kellerza.github.io/sunsynk/reference/definitions#available-sensors)** project, in four variants (`1PH`, `1PH-16kw`, `3PH`, `3PH-hv`). The **SG05LP1 target is single-phase → the `1PH` column**, and that map already hands us almost the whole canonical metric set *and* the full work-mode-timer control registers (its `Prog1..6` Time/Power/Capacity/Charge/Voltage/Mode = the 6 timer slots of §4/§12). This **empirically validates the `deye-base` + per-variant-override design** (§4) and the per-phase vocabulary (§4). **But community maps contain errors and internal address collisions** (e.g. in the `1PH` column `[184]` is listed for *both* Battery SOC and AUX L1 current; the per-phase Gen/AUX block looks mis-applied to single-phase) and shift with firmware — so the map is a **seed to verify, never to trust blindly** (§10 register-map-accuracy risk). Phase −1 therefore becomes *targeted verification* rather than blind discovery, but is **not skippable**: every address/scale/sign is still confirmed against the inverter's own screen.

Three subcommands:
- **`scan`** — one read-only snapshot, labelled with the system state and the values read off the inverter screen (`--label`, `--condition key=value`, `--note`). Writes `snapshot-*.json` + `.csv`. Stamps vendor/model/firmware into each file. Reads either a contiguous range (`--start..--end`) **or**, with **`--map sunsynk-deye.tsv` (optionally `--variant`), only the registers a candidate map references** — clustered into a few transactions (nearby addresses merged, empty gaps skipped) so onboarding doesn't sweep hundreds of irrelevant registers. Two capture modes:
  - *active* (default): act as the Modbus master and poll the range.
  - *passive* (`--passive`): when the port is already in use by another master (the stock logger/poller), **sniff** its RS485 traffic instead — open the port non-exclusively, reconstruct + CRC-check Modbus RTU frames, and pair each response with its request to recover addresses. No second master on the bus, so no collisions; captures only what the other master polls.
- **`report`** — consolidates all snapshots into **`regscan-report.md`**, a Markdown file **designed to be pasted to Claude**: it carries an instructions preamble, the device/firmware metadata, the captured states, a "registers that changed across states" table (the map-these-first list), and a full decoded dump. A matching `regscan-report.json` is emitted for machine use. With **`--map sunsynk-deye.tsv` (optionally `--variant`)** it annotates every known register with the map's **name [group] + decoded value** (e.g. `Battery SOC [diagnostics] = 78`) instead of the heuristic hint, surfacing map **collisions** inline for resolution against the screen — turning the report into a validation of the candidate map rather than blind discovery.
- **`verify`** — checks a **candidate map** (the kellerza/sunsynk table saved as TSV, or a JSON `{name: cell}`) against observed values from `--from` a prior snapshot, `--mock`, or live `--port`. It decodes each register **the way the map says** (`[190] S` → signed, `[183] * 0.01` → scaled, `[232] & 0x01` → masked, `[63,64]` → multi-register), so it can be ticked against the inverter screen. Two modes:
  - **Single variant** (`--variant 1PH`): a per-register decode table + the map's own **address-collision** flags. This confirms the kellerza seed for *this* model/firmware before it becomes `profiles/sunsynk-8k-sg05lp1.yaml`.
  - **All variants** (omit `--variant`): decodes **every** column (`1PH`/`1PH-16kw`/`3PH`/`3PH-hv`) side by side from one scan and reports per-variant **readable-vs-rejected** coverage to **detect the inverter type** — the correct variant reads its own registers (few rejections) while wrong ones hit out-of-range addresses and error out. Emits a `name × variant` decoded-value grid (`verify-matrix.csv`) to confirm the winning column row-by-row. (Scan the full `0..708` union range so wrong-variant addresses are actually probed.)

### What it does
- **Sweep** a configurable register range (holding *and* input registers) for a given Modbus slave id — read in safe block sizes, handle gaps/exceptions gracefully, retry with backoff.
- **Decode each register multiple ways** so values are recognisable: raw `uint16`, `int16`, and adjacent-pair `uint32`/`int32` (both word orders), plus common scalings (×0.1, ×0.01). Print all candidates per address.
- **Annotate** with plausibility hints (e.g. a value near 50.0 with ×0.01 → grid Hz; 0–100 → could be SoC %; ~230/400 → voltage).
- **Read-only.** Never writes a holding register — discovery must not change inverter settings.

### How the map gets worked out (the actual method)
- **Correlate against the inverter's own display.** Note SoC %, PV power, battery V/A, grid power on the screen, run a scan, and find the register whose decoded value matches → that's the address + scaling + signedness.
- **Differential scanning.** Snapshot, change one known condition (cover a panel, switch a load, let the battery charge/discharge), snapshot again, and **diff** — the registers that moved in the expected direction reveal PV/load/battery/grid power and the **sign convention**.
- **Timestamped logging.** Each scan writes a CSV/JSON snapshot (`ts, address, raw, decodings…`) so multiple runs can be diffed offline and the reasoning is auditable.

### Output
- The **`regscan-report.md`** consolidated report — paste to Claude, which proposes a first-cut **`profiles/sunsynk-8k-sg05lp1.yaml`** (address, type, scale, signedness, word order, unit, canonical-metric key) — the input to `SunsynkProfile` in Phase 1.
- The **writable settings map** (work-mode timer slots + globals) for the control feature: change a timer slot **on the inverter's own panel**, re-scan, and diff to locate the holding registers behind each setting → feeds the profile's `settings_schema`/`encode`. (Discovery itself stays read-only; the tool only *finds* the writable registers, it doesn't write them.)
- Raw `snapshot-*.json`/`.csv` logs kept in-repo as evidence / for re-deriving if firmware changes.

### Reuse
- Same tool serves **any future vendor/model** — point it at a different device to bootstrap a new profile. It's the standard "onboard a new inverter" utility, not a one-off.
- Records the connected unit's **Protocol/MCU/COMM versions** (2.1 / 5386 / e43d here) in each scan so a map is always tied to the firmware it was derived from.

## 12. Write-Back / Control Safety

Writing to the inverter is the one feature that can do harm, so it's deliberately constrained:

### Gated off by default (deployment flag)
- A single deploy flag — **`SOLAR_MANAGER_ENABLE_CONTROL`** (env var / compose setting), default **`false`** — governs all write capability.
- When **off**: write endpoints return **403**, the Control page is hidden, and the device's `"control"` capability is suppressed. The app is **monitoring-only out of the box**, so someone who doesn't know what they're doing can't accidentally reprogram their inverter.
- When **on**: control surfaces for devices whose profile declares a `settings_schema`. The flag is intentionally a *deployment* decision (not a UI toggle a casual user flips) — opt-in, documented, with a clear "you are enabling writes to your inverter" warning.
- No user roles/auth (single-house LAN install, §1) — the deploy flag *is* the gate. Protection is the flag + the layered write safeguards below, not login permissions.

### Layered write protections (all apply when control is enabled)
1. **Schema validation** — every field bounded by `SettingsSchema` (SoC 0–100, power ≤ inverter rating, valid times, enum membership). Enforced client- **and** server-side; reject before any register is touched.
2. **Write-register allow-list** — the profile may only write the specific holding registers in its settings map. No arbitrary-address writes are possible through the API.
3. **Explicit confirmation** — UI shows a **diff** (current → proposed) and requires confirm before sending.
4. **Read-back verification** — after writing, re-read the affected registers; if they don't match the intended values, surface a **mismatch/rollback** rather than reporting success.
5. **Atomic-ish slot writes & concurrency** — apply a timer slot as a coherent set; use the settings **etag/`If-Match`** so a stale edit can't clobber a change made elsewhere (409 on conflict).
6. **Audit log** — every write recorded (when / source client / old→new / result) for traceability and to undo. (No "who" — single-house install has no user accounts, §1.)
7. **Dummy-first** — the whole flow is built and tested against the in-memory dummy inverter before being pointed at real hardware.

---

## Resolved Decisions (answers to the open questions)

1. **Inverter model: Sunsynk `SYNK-8K-SG05LP1`** — 8 kW single-phase hybrid. Concrete target for `SunsynkProfile`; build `profiles/sunsynk-8k-sg05lp1.yaml` against this model's register map.
   **Firmware (confirmed on the unit):** Protocol version **2.1**, MCU version **5386**, COMM version **e43d**. Pin the profile to these; if a future firmware update changes them, re-validate the register map (firmware can shift addresses). Record these in the profile metadata so a mismatch can be detected/warned at connect time.
2. **Wiring: the combined BMS/RS485 port.** First transport reads Modbus RTU off this port via a USB-RS485 adapter. **Confirmed: reading does not interrupt inverter↔BMS comms** — no bus contention, so this port is the supported v1 connection.
3. **Battery: Lithium (LiFePO₄), managed by the inverter over CAN.** Inverter config (confirmed on the unit): Battery type **Lithium**, Lithium protocol **CAN (protocol 0)**, Battery operation **State of Charge**, Battery capacity **312 Ah**. The inverter talks to the BMS over CAN and is in **SoC mode**, so SoC comes from the BMS (accurate, not voltage-estimated) and battery metrics (SoC, V, A, temp) come *through the inverter's registers* — no separate BMS device needed on this rig. **But inverters differ on both reading and writing the BMS**, so the model must support these topologies (a per-battery **BMS topology** config setting selects which):
   - **Inverter-relayed BMS, read-only:** battery metrics decoded from the inverter profile; BMS not writable.
   - **Inverter-relayed BMS, read + write** (some inverters, possibly this one): BMS settings are exposed as writable holding registers *on the inverter*, so BMS control rides the inverter's `settings_schema` (§4) and the same write-safety path (§12).
   - **Direct BMS connection:** the inverter does **not** relay (or doesn't relay writes), so the BMS is a **separate `Device`** — its own transport (its own RS485/CAN-bridge link + a BMS profile) — contributing battery metrics *and* its own `settings_schema` for BMS control, merged by `device_id` into the system view.
   The profile's `capabilities()` declares whether it provides battery metrics, and `settings_schema()` whether the BMS is writable through it; if neither, the system expects a separate BMS device. Config records the chosen topology + (for direct) the BMS connection params.
   **Live battery level = SoC (%), not kWh.** The inverter reports **State of Charge as a percentage** — that's the authoritative live battery metric (canonical key `battery_soc_pct`), stored and charted as-is. It does **not** report energy-in-battery directly.
   **kWh is derived, only when needed** (battery trajectory projection in §6, "hours of autonomy" stats): `energy_kWh ≈ (SoC% / 100) × capacity_kWh`, where `capacity_kWh = capacity_Ah × V_nom`. The inverter reports **capacity = 312 Ah**; nominal pack voltage (48 V-class ≈ 51.2 V → ~16 kWh) comes from inverter/BMS if exposed, else user-set. **Inverter wins** for any value it reports; user config is fallback only. *Usable* energy additionally factors the configured min-SoC / depth-of-discharge.
4. **Array & site spec: fully user-configurable** (not hard-coded). Settings UI captures **kWp, tilt, azimuth, string/array layout, lat/lon**, and the **panel datasheet params — Temperature Coefficient of Pmax (%/°C) and NMOT (°C)** (these are ABC panels); the forecast service (§6) uses the latter two for the thermal derate. **Current values (confirmed):** γ_Pmax = **−0.26 %/°C**, NMOT = **41 °C** — use these as the defaults for this array. Support **multiple array segments** (e.g. east + west strings at different tilt/azimuth, possibly different module types) since the SG05LP1 has two MPPTs — each segment forecast separately and summed.
5. **Tariffs: flat *and* time-of-use, for both directions.** Model both **import (purchase)** and **export (feed-in)** rates, each as either a flat rate or a set of **time-of-use windows** (and seasonal variants). Cost/savings stats in §3/§7 consume this.
6. **Host: a Raspberry Pi running fresh Ubuntu, native install (primary path); Docker optional.** Could also be a NAS or home server. Low-footprint design (SQLite, no heavy DB) keeps it Pi-friendly. **Native is the supported default** (see §13); Docker support is maintained as an alternative. The host with the USB-RS485 adapter must be physically near the inverter; if it can't be, that's a reason to move to the **SolarmanV5 Wi-Fi transport** later, which removes the proximity constraint.

### Still to confirm on-site (pre-Phase 1)
- **Battery capacity** — ✓ **resolved** from the inverter config: **312 Ah** (reg [204]), Lithium / CAN / SoC-mode (reg [325]=0). At the ~51.2 V class that's **≈16 kWh** (matches the forecast default `capacity_wh:16000` and the dummy). Usable depth: min-SoC (stop-discharge) **10 %**, output-shutdown 5 %.
- **Battery & grid power sign conventions** — ✓ **resolved** by the grid-charging capture (battery is discharge-positive → negated to +charge/−discharge; grid is import-positive → matches canonical). A daytime PV capture (2026-06-18) further confirmed **`pv1_voltage_v` = 265.1 V under load** (×0.1) and PV producing (441 W). **Still open (one item):** grid **export** polarity (assumed s16-negative) — the daytime scan had PV but the battery was at 61 % (not full), so it never exported; needs a **battery-full + PV-surplus** scan to confirm directly.

---

## 13. Deployment

Three ways to run, the same app in each — only packaging differs. **Running from the
working copy** is the dev/test path (no install, no hardware); **native install** is the
primary production path for the target (Raspberry Pi on fresh Ubuntu); **Docker** is
maintained as an alternative.

### Running from the working copy (development & testing) — must always work
The repo must be runnable **straight after a `git pull` + basic setup**, with no systemd,
no Docker, no hardware, and nothing to provision:
- **Backend:** `python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt`,
  then run **Uvicorn with `--reload`** from the repo root (e.g. `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`).
- **Frontend:** either `npm install && ng serve` (Angular dev server, proxying API/WS to the
  backend) for live reload, **or** a one-off `ng build` that the backend then serves — so the
  whole UI is reachable with just the backend running.
- **Defaults make it work with zero config:** the **`DummyProfile` simulator is the default
  device**, the DB is a local SQLite file in the working dir, and `SOLAR_MANAGER_ENABLE_CONTROL`
  is off — so a fresh clone produces a live, populated dashboard (synthetic data) on first run.
- A **`make dev`** target (and documented manual steps) brings up backend + frontend together.
- This path is what CI and contributors use; keep it working — if a change can only run under
  systemd/Docker, that's a regression.
- **VSCode debugging out of the box (`.vscode/`):** committed default launch profiles so opening
  the repo and pressing **F5** debugs both tiers. A **compound "Full Stack" profile** launches the
  **backend under `debugpy`** (uvicorn `app.main:app`, no `--reload` so breakpoints bind reliably)
  and the **frontend in Chrome** against the Angular dev server (a background task starts `ng serve`
  and the launch waits until it's serving), giving real breakpoints/step-through on both sides.
  `tasks.json` backs the dev-server start and a `pytest` task; `extensions.json` recommends the
  Python/Angular/JS-debug extensions. **The Phase 0 scaffold must keep these entry points
  (`backend/` → `app.main:app`, `frontend/` → dev server on :4200, venv at `./.venv`) in sync**
  so F5 keeps working.

### A. Native install on Raspberry Pi / Ubuntu (primary)
- **Targets:** fresh **Ubuntu** (Server/Desktop) on a Raspberry Pi (ARM64); also any Debian/Ubuntu x86 box.
- **Backend:** Python venv (`python3 -m venv`), `pip install -r requirements.txt`, run **Uvicorn/Gunicorn** under a **systemd service** (`solar-manager.service`) so it starts on boot and restarts on failure.
- **Frontend:** Angular built to static files (`ng build`) and **served by the FastAPI app itself** (or nginx) — one process, one port, no separate web server needed.
- **Database:** SQLite file under `/var/lib/solar-manager/` (or the service user's home). Nothing to provision.
- **Serial access:** add the service user to the **`dialout`** group for `/dev/ttyUSB*` access to the USB-RS485 adapter; pin the adapter to a stable path via a **udev rule** (so it isn't `ttyUSB0` one boot and `ttyUSB1` the next).
- **Config:** a single `.env` / config file (DB path, serial port, poll interval, `SOLAR_MANAGER_ENABLE_CONTROL`, etc.); systemd `EnvironmentFile`.
- **Install ergonomics:** an **`install.sh`** (and a `Makefile`) that creates the venv, builds the frontend, installs the systemd unit, sets up the udev rule and group — fresh-Ubuntu-to-running in one script. Document the manual steps too.
- **Updates:** `git pull` + rebuild + `systemctl restart`; SQLite makes backup a file copy.

### B. Docker (optional, maintained)
- **`Dockerfile`** (multi-stage: build Angular, assemble Python app) + **`docker-compose.yml`**.
- **Multi-arch image** (ARM64 + amd64) so the same Compose file runs on the Pi or an x86 server.
- Pass the serial device through (`devices: ["/dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0"]`), persist the DB via a named volume, supply config via env.
- Same single container serves API + static frontend; same env flags (incl. control flag).

### Releases (tag-triggered → GitHub Releases)
Cutting a release is driven entirely by **pushing a git tag matching `version/x.y`** (e.g. `version/1.0`, `version/2.3`) — a GitHub Actions workflow does the rest:
- **Trigger:** `.github/workflows/release.yml` runs on `push` of tags matching `version/*`.
- **Gate first:** the release build **re-runs the full CI hard gates (§21)** — build, unit tests, coverage, no-CDN check. A red build never produces a release.
- **Version derivation:** the **`x.y`** is parsed from the tag (`version/x.y` → `x.y`) and is the single source of truth — it **names the GitHub Release** (release title = `x.y`), tags the artifacts, and is **stamped into the app** so the footer (§8) and `/api/health` report the running version (no hand-edited version constants).
- **Artifacts attached to the release:**
  - a versioned source/runtime bundle (`solar-manager-x.y.tar.gz`) containing the production `ng build` output (self-hosted assets, no CDN), the backend, `install.sh`, and the systemd unit — i.e. a native-install-ready package;
  - optionally the multi-arch (arm64+amd64) Docker image pushed to **GHCR** tagged `x.y` (and `latest`).
- **Publish:** the workflow creates the GitHub Release named `x.y` with auto-generated release notes (changelog from commits/PRs since the previous `version/*` tag) and uploads the artifacts. Releases live on the repo the Project tracks; the workflow activates once the repo is on GitHub.

### Shared principles
- **No build step required at runtime** in either path beyond the one-time frontend build (baked into the image / done by `install.sh`).
- **One config surface** (env vars) used identically by both paths — so docs and the control flag behave the same way.
- Keep the dependency set lean (SQLite, no external broker/DB) precisely so the **native Pi install stays trivial**.

## 14. Integrations & Data Egress

This class of app is judged heavily on how well it plays with the rest of a home stack. All of the below are **optional, config-gated, and off the hot path** — egress runs in a separate async task fed off the poller's reading stream, so a failing integration degrades to a warning, never blocks polling/persistence. All are driven by the **canonical metric vocabulary** (§4), so they're brand-independent and come free for every profile.

- **MQTT publisher** — publish each normalized `Reading` + per-device status to a broker. The single most-requested integration for self-hosted solar.
  - **Home Assistant MQTT auto-discovery** — emit HA discovery configs so every metric appears as an HA sensor with **zero manual YAML** (dashboards, automations, HA Energy panel). Makes the system a first-class HA citizen.
- **PVOutput.org** — optional periodic upload (generation, consumption, SoC, temperature) to the popular community comparison service. API key + system id in Settings.
- **Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint** — expose live metrics for users already running Grafana, so they can build their own dashboards/alerts.
- **Generic outbound webhook** — POST readings/events to a user URL (Node-RED, IFTTT, custom).
- The read-only **REST + WebSocket API (§7) is already the inbound/public surface**; these add *push*-style egress.

## 15. Alerts & Notifications

A rule-driven alerting subsystem (the original Phase-6 one-liner, fleshed out — alerting is table-stakes for unattended power systems):

- **Rule engine** — user-defined conditions on any canonical metric or system state: `battery_soc_pct < 20`, sustained high grid import, **device offline / stale data**, **inverter fault/alarm raised** (§16), forecast predicts depletion, over-temperature. With thresholds, hysteresis, debounce, and **quiet hours**.
- **Notification channels** (pluggable, like transports): email (SMTP), **Telegram**, **ntfy**, **Pushover/Gotify**, webhook, and in-app toast/inbox. Selectable per rule.
- **Alert inbox & history** — active + acknowledged alerts, past-firing log, snooze/ack; surfaced via a header bell badge.
- **Sensible defaults shipped on** — low-SoC, source-offline/stale-data, inverter-fault — all editable.

## 16. Inverter Alarms & Fault Decoding

Beyond `inverter_status`, real inverters expose **fault/alarm bitfields and run-state codes** users depend on for diagnosis:
- Canonical keys `inverter_fault_codes`, `inverter_warning_codes`, `run_state` (§4).
- Each profile maps its raw fault/warning registers → a **normalized list of human-readable codes**, declared in the profile YAML alongside metrics (so it's per-brand data, not core code).
- Surfaced on the **Now** view (fault banner), fed into the alert engine (§15), and **logged to history** so intermittent faults are catchable after the fact.

## 17. Battery Health & BMS Detail

SoC alone undersells what owners want from a battery:
- **State of Health (SoH)**, **cycle count**, **measured full-charge capacity / degradation** where the BMS exposes them — optional canonical keys (`battery_soh_pct`, `battery_cycles`, `battery_capacity_ah_measured`).
- **Cell-level detail** for direct-BMS topologies (Decision #3): per-cell voltages, min/max/delta, cell temperatures, **balancing status** — a dedicated battery-detail panel, gated by `capabilities()`.
- **Round-trip efficiency** and charge/discharge throughput derived from history.
- All capability-driven: rigs that only report SoC simply don't show these (missing ≠ zero, §4).

## 18. Smart Automation & Scheduling (built on Control)

The natural high-value extension once monitoring + forecast + control + tariffs all exist — and the flagship feature of comparable tools (Predbat, Sunsynk smart-load):
- **Automation engine** that *writes* the work-mode timer automatically from rules: "force grid-charge during the cheapest ToU window", "raise target SoC when tomorrow's forecast is poor", "hold charge for an expected evening peak".
- **Tariff + forecast optimization** — combine §5 tariffs and §6 forecast into a proposed daily timer plan that minimizes cost / maximizes self-consumption.
- **Strictly opt-in, built entirely on §12 safeguards** — every automated write runs the same validate→write→read-back→audit path, gated behind the control flag **and** a separate automation flag. **Dry-run / "suggest only" mode first** (show the plan, don't write).
- Sequenced **after** Control (in "Later") — the schema-driven settings + forecast + tariffs are deliberately laid so this slots in with no core changes.

## 19. Operational & UX Essentials

Cross-cutting items expected of a polished self-hosted app:
- **First-run setup wizard** — guided onboarding: confirm device (dummy preselected), location (lat/lon auto-suggested, editable), array segments, battery, tariffs — so a fresh install reaches a useful state without hand-editing config.
- **Backup / restore & data export** — one-click SQLite backup + restore in the UI; **CSV/Excel export** of history for any metric/range (documented file-copy backup stays trivial with SQLite).
- **Database migrations** — schema versioned via **Alembic** (§5) so upgrades preserve history.
- **Diagnostics / observability** — structured, level-configurable logging and a **Diagnostics page** extending `/api/health`: per-device Modbus comms stats (success/timeout/retry counts, last error, round-trip time), DB size, rollup lag.
- **Localization & formatting** — configurable **currency** (tariffs/savings), units, date/time format, timezone; i18n scaffolding (strings externalized) even if only English ships first.
- **Installable PWA** — manifest + service worker so the dashboard installs to a phone home screen and rides out brief network blips; pairs with the existing offcanvas mobile layout.
- **Grid-outage / backup-power event log** — detect and log loss/return of grid (islanding) from grid metrics — a commonly-wanted timeline for hybrid/backup systems.
- **Environmental & ROI stats** — **CO₂ avoided** and **savings / payback (ROI)** on the History view, reusing existing energy + tariff data.
- **Inverter clock sync** — optionally read and (under control) correct inverter time drift; a frequent real-world annoyance.
- **Free & open source (BSD 3-Clause, © Darren Horrocks)** — the whole project is BSD-3 licensed (`LICENSE`); keep dependencies license-compatible.
- **User-facing `README.md`, kept current** — the front door for home users: how simple it is to run, the feature set, and that it's free/open-source. It carries a **Project status** notice that's updated as the app progresses, and is the primary "get people running it at home" surface (design detail stays in `plan.md`).

## 20. Vendor Roadmap & Protocol Families

The architecture exists to make **adding a vendor a data/plugin task, not a core change**. Beyond the Sunsynk/Sol-Ark/Deye family already targeted, the following are **candidate vendors, added on demand** (per support request) — listed here to keep the design honest about what it must accommodate. They are **not homogeneous**, which is exactly why the device seam is kept protocol-agnostic (§4):

### By protocol family (how each connects)
- **Modbus register-map family** (RTU / TCP / SolarmanV5) — the common case; each is a versioned `profiles/<vendor>-<model>.yaml` (+ rare custom decode), often sharing a base map per firmware family (like `deye-base`):
  **Goodwe, Growatt, Solis (Ginlong), Sungrow, SAJ, SRNE, LuxPower, Sigenergy, Senergy, Megarevo, Afore, Sumry, Felicity, Huawei (SUN2000, Modbus-TCP), Midnite Solar (charge controllers), Must (Modbus models).** Three-phase models are covered by the per-phase canonical keys (§4). **SunSpec-compliant** units (some Goodwe, Huawei, etc.) can be read by **one generic SunSpec profile** rather than a bespoke map.
- **Text command/response family** (proprietary ASCII, no register space) — `PI30`/`QPIGS`-style command→response with CRC over serial or USB-HID:
  **Voltronic (Axpert/MKS), Must (PV18/PI30 models), and similar low-cost hybrids.** Needs a *text-command transport* + a *command-set profile* (which queries to poll, where each field sits in the reply) — a different intra-family contract from registers, but it still emits the same normalized `Reading`.
- **Victron family** — its own ecosystem; integrate via **Venus OS (GX) Modbus-TCP or MQTT**, or **VE.Direct** text on smaller units. Its own transport(s)+profile; metrics normalize like everything else.

### What "in a place that allows this" requires (and the plan already provides)
1. **Protocol-agnostic seam (§4):** the cross-family contract is `Reading` + optional `SettingsSchema`, *not* registers — so the text/Victron families are additive, never a refactor. **This is the load-bearing decision; protect it in v1** by keeping `dict[int,int]`/Modbus specifics inside the Modbus family.
2. **Profiles as versioned data + a registry:** drop a YAML (or, for the odd protocol, a small profile module) into `profiles/` and a registry auto-discovers it; nothing in core changes. **Per-firmware pinning** (as done for the SG05LP1) and **shared base inheritance** generalise to every rebadge family.
3. **Capability-driven UI (§4):** each profile advertises which canonical metrics/settings it provides, so wildly different devices (a Midnite charge controller vs a 3-phase Sungrow vs a Voltronic off-grid unit) each render only what they actually report — no per-vendor UI code.
4. **Schema-driven control (§4/§12):** every vendor's writable settings come from its own `SettingsSchema`, so the generic Control page already handles them.
5. **Onboarding tooling reality check:** `regscan` (§11) bootstraps the **Modbus family** only. The **text** and **Victron** families will need their own (smaller) onboarding helpers — noted now so it isn't a surprise; not built until a request for one of those vendors lands.

**Sequencing:** demand-driven, in *Later* (§9). Each Modbus vendor is a new YAML; the first **text-family** and first **Victron** vendor each carry a one-time cost (build that family's transport + profile contract), after which their siblings are cheap. Mixed-brand systems (e.g. a Sungrow inverter + a separate BMS) already work via the multi-device registry (§4/§5).

## 21. Testing & Quality

**Unit testing is mandatory, not optional.** Every deliverable (§9 / `TASKS.md`) ships with tests as part of its *Definition of Done* — code without tests is not done. The **dummy-first** design (§4) exists partly to make this possible: the whole stack runs and is testable with **no hardware**, deterministically.

### What gets tested (and how hard)
The codebase splits cleanly into pure logic (cheap, high-value to test) and I/O glue (harder, lower return), so coverage expectations are **tiered**, not a flat number:

- **Critical pure logic — target ≥ 90% line coverage, near-100% on the gnarly bits:**
  - **Profile decode/normalization** — register → canonical metric: scaling, signed/unsigned, 16/32-bit word order, offsets (the `(°C+100)×10` temp), bitfield/fault decoding, and **sign-convention normalization** (battery charge/discharge, grid import/export). This is the #1 bug source (§10), so it's tested hardest — table-driven cases with known raw→expected vectors captured from real `regscan` snapshots.
  - **Settings encode/read round-trip** (§4) — typed settings ↔ holding registers must round-trip exactly; property-based tests where practical.
  - **Write-safety logic** (§12) — schema validation bounds/enums, the **write-register allow-list** (assert out-of-allow-list addresses are rejected), read-back-verify mismatch handling. Safety code is tested adversarially.
  - **Energy accounting** (§5) — counter-diff vs integration, midnight-reset detection, missed-sample handling.
  - **Forecast model** (§6) — POA transposition, NMOT thermal derate, SoC trajectory — against hand-computed expected values.
  - **Stats** (§3) — self-consumption/autonomy/cost/ROI from fixture series.
- **I/O & glue — lighter, behaviour-focused:** transports (Modbus/Solarman framing) tested against recorded/faked byte exchanges, not live hardware; API endpoints via FastAPI `TestClient`; repository against an in-memory/temp SQLite.
- **Frontend** — presentational components and services unit-tested (each component ships its own test, §8); ~70%+ is reasonable given UI glue. Schema-form builder and the WebSocket/Theme services are tested explicitly.

### Integration / end-to-end tests — Playwright, driving the real app on the dummy
A second test tier covers what unit tests **structurally cannot**: behaviour that only emerges when the whole app is actually running and a user drives it through the browser. These run the **full stack** (FastAPI serving the built Angular app) against the **`DummyProfile` + `NullTransport`** config — deterministic (fixed seed), no hardware — and exercise it as an automated user.

**Scope discipline — integration tests cover only the un-unit-testable.** If a thing can be checked by calling a function or a single endpoint, it stays a unit test. Playwright is reserved for **cross-layer, user-observable flows end-to-end**, e.g.:
- **Live data path:** a `Reading` pushed over the WebSocket actually updates the gauges/flow diagram in the DOM (poller → WS → RxJS store → component render — a chain no unit test spans).
- **Socket-drop degradation:** kill the socket, assert the status pill goes amber and the client falls back to polling `/api/live` and keeps updating (§8).
- **Control round-trip against the dummy's in-memory write path (§4/§12):** open the schema-driven Control page, edit a work-mode-timer slot, see the current→proposed **diff**, confirm, and assert the **read-back-verified confirmed state** renders — the whole validate→confirm→write→read-back loop through real UI + API + device, with control enabled in the test env.
- **Schema-driven UI generation:** the Control form is *generated* from the dummy's `settings_schema` — assert the right fields/inputs appear, proving the generic form builder works against a live schema.
- **Navigation, theming, charts:** theme toggle persists across reload; History/Forecast charts render for a known fixture range; first-run wizard reaches a usable state.

What stays **out** of Playwright: register decode/scaling/sign math, settings encode/read, energy/forecast/stats arithmetic, allow-list rejection logic — all of that is faster and more thorough as unit tests (above). E2E asserts the *wiring and the user experience*, not the arithmetic.

- **Mechanics:** Playwright (TS) with headless Chromium/WebKit; a fixture boots the app in dummy mode on an ephemeral port and tears it down; tests are seed-deterministic so live values are assertable. Control-flow tests set `SOLAR_MANAGER_ENABLE_CONTROL=true` only in that test env.

### The bar (CI gate)
- **All tests pass — 100% green is the merge gate.** Non-negotiable; a red unit **or Playwright E2E** suite blocks merge.
- **Overall backend line coverage ≥ 80%**, with the critical-logic modules above held to **≥ 90%** (enforced per-package, so high coverage of trivial code can't mask an untested decoder). Coverage thresholds fail the build, not just warn.
- These numbers are deliberately *reasonable, not vanity 100%* — the goal is that everything that can silently corrupt data or mis-program the inverter is covered, while not chasing coverage on glue where it adds little.

### Mechanics
- **Backend:** `pytest` + `pytest-cov` (coverage gate), `pytest-asyncio` for async, deterministic **dummy with a fixed seed** for reproducible readings; `regscan` snapshots checked in as decode fixtures.
- **Frontend:** Angular 21's default **vitest + jsdom** runner for component/service specs — headless, no browser needed (good for CI); optional Storybook (§8) doubling as visual regression.
- **Integration/E2E:** **Playwright** (TS) driving the full app in dummy mode (above); a fixture boots backend+frontend on an ephemeral port, seed-deterministic, torn down after.
- **CI = GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), runs on every push and pull request using the **working-copy run path** (§13) — no hardware, no Docker required. Tests live alongside code and land in the same PR as the feature. (The workflow file lives in-repo and activates once the repo is on GitHub.)

### CI pipeline & hard gates
The Action is the enforcement point — **every one of these is a hard gate that fails the build (red), not a warning:**
1. **Build/compile** — backend imports & installs cleanly (`pip install -r requirements.txt`); frontend `ng build` succeeds with **no build errors** (and lint/type errors treated as errors).
2. **Unit tests** — full `pytest` + frontend suites run; **any test failure fails CI**. 100% green is required to merge.
3. **Coverage** — `pytest-cov` (and the frontend coverage reporter) enforce the §21 thresholds: **overall backend ≥ 80%, critical-logic modules ≥ 90%**, frontend ~70%. **Below threshold fails the build**, same as a test failure.
4. **Playwright E2E** — boot the full app in dummy mode and run the integration suite headless; **any failure fails CI**. (E2E is a pass/fail gate, not a coverage-measured one.)
5. **No-CDN check** (§8) — a step that greps the built frontend for external URLs and fails if any CDN/font reference leaked in.

Backend and frontend run as separate jobs (matrix where useful); a clone with no hardware must go green, so the dummy default + checked-in fixtures are what CI exercises. Branch protection should require this workflow to pass before merge once the repo is on GitHub.
